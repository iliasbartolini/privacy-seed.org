Privacy Seed is an installation to challenge the intersections of personal spaces and data privacy, the connection of
human identity and its digital extensions.
A wooden tree structure holds at its center an anatomical heart with a heartbeat sensor. By holding it in their hands
the participants start interacting with the tree.
The sensor readings are used to “seed” a secure digital random number generator that is one of the foundational elements of modern cryptography.

> “Arguing that you don't care about  the right
to privacy because you have nothing to hide
is no different than saying you don't care about
free speech because you have nothing to say.”
>                                           ― Edward Snowden

Participants are invited to answer the question that is at the beginning of this page:

> "WHAT DO YOU LOVE AND HOPE TO PROTECT FROM DIGITAL MASS SURVEILLANCE AND EROSION OF PRIVACY?"

Their answers are collected on ribbons tied to the branches of the tree.

Privacy Seed is a reflection on our personal-and-digital identity boundaries. It is an exploration of our intimate spaces and their public digital shadows.
