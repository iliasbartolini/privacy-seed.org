Hi,
I’m Ilias Bartolini,  
I have been a software engineer for 15+ years and this project is the result of my growing interest in privacy and digital rights.  
In the recent years I've been interested in supporting journalists and human rights defenders in the adoption of secure communication practices. 

A period of exploration in interdisciplinary practices and spaces has brought to life the idea of Privacy Seed.
